# TEK5030 Deep Learning Torch

This tutorial can be run both locally and in the cloud through [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/).

# Run locally
If you have a computer with a decent GPU I recommend running locally. You need python 3.7 or higher and pip installed.
You also need jupyter, torch, scikit-learn and torchvision, which can be installed with:

```
pip3 install jupyter torch torchvision scikti-learn
```

then open the notebook with:

```
jupyter notebook TEK5030_deep_learning_torch.ipynb
```

or if you want to browse the entire folder:

```
jupyter notebook
```

I have also exported the code only for part of the exercise to regular python files, 
for those who prefer not running in a notebook.

### Live training exercise
This execise can only be run through python directly. Here we use a webcam to finetune a network
in realtime. The exercise can be found in *EX3_simple_conv_net.py*.

# Run in Colaboratory
you can open the notebook by clicking:

<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/sigmunjr/TEK5030_deep_learning_torch/blob/main/TEK5030_deep_learning_torch.ipynb" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>

You need a google account to run the code.
