    "\n",
    "PyTorch provide a simplified interface for this, with [torch.optim](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html). An optimizer is initialized with the parameters or tensors it is supposed to optimize. With a torch.nn.Module this is simply done with e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling *optimizer.step()* will then update the tensor based on the gradient information. Calling *optimizer.zero_grad()* will zero out all the gradients ahead of a new step. A training step could then be done as following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "optimizer.zero_grad()\n",
    "ouput = model(x)\n",
    "loss = calculate_loss(x, target)\n",
    "loss.backward()\n",
    "optimizer.step()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In [torch.optim](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#algorithms) you can find many implementations of different optimization algorithms. They all subtrackt some scaled version of the gradients from the parameters, but use various information to decide the step-size/scale. For simple tests i prefere to use [Adam](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.optim.Adam.html#torch.optim.Adam) as it is more robust to the input parameters than many of the other methods (you will need less parameter tuneing).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Tips for training**\n",
    "Start by training your network with just a small dataset, e.g. one batch. \n",
    "\n",
    "To check you have properly initialized your weights and scaled your inputs you can check your initial loss. Your initial loss should be roughly equal to *-ln(1/N)*, where N is the number of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "When training on a small version of your dataset your accuracy should steadily rise to 1. If it does not, you could try to adjust your learning rate. Your learning rate should generally be as high as possible, while still not increase your loss at the begining of your training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adam is often a good optimizer for quick tests, as it requires comparably less *tuning* of the learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can quite easily calculate your own loss function, but for convinience you can use [torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy.html#torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy).\n",
    "\n",
    "**TODO**:\n",
    "Train the network and validate that the loss goes down. The dataset are small so we cannot expect very good accuracy, additionally colab provide less resources than previously. Therefore **do not** expect a very good result, just better than random. While you could get a decent result with a small model, I recommend to move on after your model just get a loss sligtly below ln(num_classes)=0.693.\n",
